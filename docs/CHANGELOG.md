# Pluto Product/Development Journal

This is Pluto's human-readable development journal. It is not a formal release-notes file.

Use it to capture shipped changes, meaningful experiments, reversals, and changes in product direction. Good entries explain what changed, why it changed, and what assumption or previous direction it replaced.

## Entry Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

### Short change title
- **Issue:** #123
- **PR:** #456
- **Changed:** What shipped or changed.
- **Why:** The product or technical reason.
- **Replaced:** The prior assumption, workflow, behavior, or plan this supersedes.

### Add PM housekeeping GitHub preflight
- **Issue:** [#67](https://github.com/metagrover/pluto/issues/67)
- **PR:** Not opened yet.
- **Changed:** Added a `pm:github-preflight` check that verifies environment-backed GitHub auth, API reachability, issue listing, and optional issue-comment mutation without logging token values.
- **Why:** Recurring PM automation needs to distinguish missing secrets, invalid auth, network failures, and mutation failures before grooming issues.
- **Replaced:** Relying on interactive `gh` keyring auth as evidence that cron automation can access GitHub.
- **Notes:** The local interactive shell still has keyring-backed auth only; the recurring runtime needs `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` injected by the host environment.

### Adopt issue-driven agentic development
- **Issue:** [#55](https://github.com/metagrover/pluto/issues/55)
- **PR:** Not opened yet.
- **Changed:** Added an Issues-first workflow for active product and implementation work, with repo docs reserved for durable memory.
- **Why:** Pluto's product direction evolves as the app becomes more real. GitHub Issues provide a better live surface for divergence, discussion, scope updates, and acceptance criteria than static PRDs.
- **Replaced:** PRD-first planning as the default source of truth for active work.
- **Notes:** This first version intentionally uses templates and agent ritual rather than CI enforcement.
