# Pluto Product/Development Journal

This is Pluto's human-readable development journal. It is not a formal release-notes file.

Use it to capture shipped changes, meaningful experiments, reversals, and changes in product direction. Good entries explain what changed, why it changed, and what assumption or previous direction it replaced.

## Entry Format

```markdown

### Adopt issue-driven agentic development
- **Issue:** [#55](https://github.com/metagrover/pluto/issues/55)
- **PR:** Not opened yet.
- **Changed:** Added an Issues-first workflow for active product and implementation work, with repo docs reserved for durable memory.
- **Why:** Pluto's product direction evolves as the app becomes more real. GitHub Issues provide a better live surface for divergence, discussion, scope updates, and acceptance criteria than static PRDs.
- **Replaced:** PRD-first planning as the default source of truth for active work.
- **Notes:** This first version intentionally uses templates and agent ritual rather than CI enforcement.
